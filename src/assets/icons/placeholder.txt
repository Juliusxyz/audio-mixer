# Icon Placeholders

This folder contains placeholder icon files. Replace these with actual PNG icons for the applications.

For now, you can add PNG files with these names to see real icons:

- discord.png (for Discord)
- spotify.png (for Spotify)  
- chrome.png (for Google Chrome)
- firefox.png (for Firefox)
- steam.png (for Steam)
- vlc.png (for VLC Media Player)
- obs.png (for OBS Studio)
- vscode.png (for Visual Studio Code)

The system will automatically detect and use these icons when the corresponding applications are running.
